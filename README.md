## Semester Project for ECE327: Digital Systems VLSI

### **Part A**
In this part of the project, we were tasked with designing and testing 4 modules: an XOR
gate, an XNOR gate, a positive edge-triggered D flip-flop and a D flip-flop with asynchronous
active-high preset and clear.

### **Part B**
In this part of the project, we were tasked with implementing a characterization flow and using
it to characterize the standard cells designed in the first part of the project. The final result is
a library file.
